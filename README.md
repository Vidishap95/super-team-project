The IMDb Top 100 Movies API from Rapid API was accessed to obtain top rated movies and their related details. The Streaming Availability API, also from Rapid API, was accessed to give movie details about the user selected movie. The Streaming Availability API uses the TMDB API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDB. Any information about issues or bugs with the website are appreciated.
