      load
      a list of movies, and organizes them into three different sections based on their ratings.
    </p1><br>
    <p2>The first section displays our favorite movies, which are considered the best of the best. These movies
      are typically critically acclaimed and have received numerous awards and accolades. Some examples of movies in
      this section include The Godfather, The Dark Knight, and The Shawshank Redemption.</p2><br>

      <li>Short film description</li>
      <li>Link to the trailer</li>

      useful for users who have heard about a specific movie and want to find out more information about it. When a user
      types in the name of a movie and clicks "Search", the webpage will display the movie in the third section along
      with
      its full description.</p5><br>
